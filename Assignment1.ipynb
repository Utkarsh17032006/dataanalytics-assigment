    "1. Why are dictionary keys required to be immutable in Python? Explain with a small example.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer:Python employs hashing to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs, so dictionary keys must be immutable. The hash value of a key is determined when it is added to a dictionary. Python wouldn't be able to find the key accurately if it were mutable and changed later because its hash value would likewise change. As a result, consistency, dependability, and quick dictionary lookups are guaranteed by immutability."
